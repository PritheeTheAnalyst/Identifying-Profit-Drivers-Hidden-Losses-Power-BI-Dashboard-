# Identifying-Profit-Drivers-Hidden-Losses-Power-BI-Dashboard-
In this project, I analyzed U.S. superstore sales data to uncover trends in revenue, profit, customer behavior, and manager performance. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable insights that support strategic business decisions.

## Project Overview
This project explores sales and profit trends from a U.S. superstore dataset for the year 2015. The goal is to uncover insights across customer segments, managers, product categories, and geographic coverage to support better business decisions.

## Purpose of the Project
To help stakeholders understand:
- Overall sales and profit performance
- How different managers perform
- Which customer segments drive sales
- Which product categories and containers generate profit or losses

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Power BI (for data visualization and dashboard creation)
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Analytical Thinking & Business Reporting

## Questions (KPIs) 
### Customer Segment Analysis
- Which customer segments drive sales over time, and how do their purchasing patterns change across months?

### Manager Performance Analysis
- How do managers differ in sales performance, customer segment contribution, and discount strategies?

### Product & Profit Analysis
- Which product categories and container types generate the highest profits, and which consistently result in losses?
